				Ths is the core of Offkit, the file that you'll output into <code>style.css</code>, that import every other codekit part &amp; that sets up your media queries. The other files imported here follow the structure above (the order is important) but you might want to comment/decomment a few lines to suit your need before you start anything else. Letâ€™s say you don't need a <b>component</b> or your project does not make use of <b>tables</b>, well, feel free to disable the corresponding line here.
